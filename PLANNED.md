# Planned Features

This document outlines upcoming features planned for the `bstack` crate. These enhancements aim to improve usability, performance, and integration while maintaining the core principles of durability, crash-safety, and simplicity. Changes aim to be backward-compatible. New features are suggested to be added as optional features under feature flags and new traits, instead of modifying existing ones, to avoid breaking changes. All features aim to follow [Rust's API design guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/) and BStack's design principles.

## NOT PLANNED

### Deprecating `BStackGuardedSlice::as_slice` in favor of read-only access

Reasons:

`BStackGuardedSlice::as_slice` is not actually unsafe as data corruption through misuse doesn't violate memory safety or compromise allocator structure, so marking it unsafe would be misleading per Rust conventions. Documentation and API design already encourage using `read()` and `write()`. Callers using `as_slice()` are expected to understand the implications. In addition, the unsafe `raw_block()` method already exists for cases where hook bypass is needed, and its safety contract documents that hooks must be manually called. If this function is deprecated, it would break existing code, and callers who correctly use `as_slice()` for read-only purposes would need to migrate. Therefore, `as_slice()` as a safe function that returns a `BStackSlice` is sufficient, and the safety contract can be clearly documented without making it `unsafe fn`.

### Replacing `std::sync::RwLock` with `parking_lot::RwLock` or `usync::RwLock`

Reasons:

There are insufficient evidences that changing the implementation of RwLock will bring sufficient performance improvements to `BStack`. `std::sync::RwLock` remains the default. On Linux, `std` wins 10/14 benchmarks, often by 20–30% on write-heavy operations which dominate real workloads. The wins for `parking_lot` and `usync` are limited to fast read-path operations (`peek`, `get`, `len`) which are not the bottleneck.

For context, accepted optimizations like caching and locked region have demonstrated **~2-10× improvements**. The gains shown here do not meet that bar and introduce an additional dependency without a compelling cross-platform case.

### Adding a singly-linked `BStackSList<T>`

Reasons:

A singly-linked variant saves 8 bytes per node by omitting `prev_ptr`, but any workload that reaches for a disk-backed linked list is already paying the cost of allocator round-trips and random-access I/O per element. An 8-byte savings per node is negligible against those overheads, and the restriction to forward-only traversal eliminates `push_front`-with-O(1)-`pop_back`, bidirectional cursors, and `split_off` without a full scan. `BStackList<T>` covers all singly-linked use cases with no meaningful extra cost, so a separate singly-linked type adds complexity without benefit.

### Making `BStackAllocator::realloc` and `dealloc` `unsafe fn`

Reasons:

While `realloc` and `dealloc` have a slice-origin requirement, the hazard window is now significantly narrowed because constructing a bad handle already requires `unsafe` (via `BStackSlice::from_raw_parts`). A well-reviewed `unsafe` block that constructs a `BStackSlice::from_raw_parts` can be expected to read the safety contract and comply with the origin requirement. The remaining concern is sub-slices: `subslice` and `subslice_range` are *safe* functions that produce slices with an origin different from any allocator-returned handle. However, marking `realloc` and `dealloc` as `unsafe fn` would force all call sites into an `unsafe` block, which may be unnecessarily burdensome given the already narrow hazard window. The best conventions use `unsafe` for operations that can cause undefined behavior and overuse of `unsafe` can lead to desensitization and misuse. As of `BStack` 0.2, the allocator interfaces are already mature and breaking changes should be avoided. Since the origin requirement is a safety contract that can be documented and enforced through careful API design, it may be sufficient to keep `realloc` and `dealloc` as safe functions while clearly documenting the requirements and risks.

Furthermore, `alloc`, `realloc`, and `dealloc` in the `BStackAllocator` trait do not need to operate on `BStackSlice` directly — they operate on an associated handle type. Custom allocator implementations can define handle types that do not support sub-slicing at all, eliminating the origin problem at the type level for those allocators. The sub-slice concern is therefore a consequence of a specific design choice (using `BStackSlice` itself as the raw handle) rather than an inherent flaw in the trait. The recommended approach is for allocators to use a handle type distinct from `BStackSlice`, where converting from handle to `BStackSlice` is straightforward but the reverse is not possible — making the origin requirement a type-level guarantee. The default allocators in this crate currently do not follow this recommendation, but that is a separate concern addressed in the planned features below.

### Adding `BStackVec<T>` for typed vector storage

Reasons:

A typed vector is a data structure, not an I/O mechanism, and `bstack`'s role is to abstract crash-safe atomic file I/O — the stack, allocators, and slices — not to provide collection types. Such structures compose on top of those mechanisms and belong downstream. `BStackByteVec` already covers the byte-buffer case, and end push/pop is already crash-atomic via a single `clen` write inherited from the stack, so a generic `BStackVec<T>` would mainly add a `bytemuck`/`zerocopy` dependency and POD-soundness surface for a generalization downstream consumers can build themselves. Keeping it out preserves the lean core and avoids freezing API surface ahead of 1.0.

### Adding `BStackList<T>` for typed doubly-linked list storage

Reasons:

As with `BStackVec<T>`, a linked list is a data-structure policy that belongs downstream rather than in the I/O core. The downstream `bllist` crate already provides on-disk doubly-linked lists built on `bstack`, with a no-corruption, recoverable-leak model: every block write is atomic, so a crash degrades to an orphaned node reclaimed on reopen rather than data corruption. The only capability that would justify a first-party type is crash-atomic multi-block structural mutation (`append`, `split_off`), which depends on the write-in-progress journaling primitive planned for 0.5.0 — and once that primitive is public, downstream crates can consume it to achieve the same guarantee. A `bstack`-native list would therefore never hold an exclusive capability. `bstack` should instead ship the mechanisms such structures need (allocators and, later, the public transaction primitive) and leave the structures themselves to downstream.

### Narrowing the `FirstFitBStackAllocator` mutex to guard only the free list

Reasons:

The mutex in `FirstFitBStackAllocator` serialises free-list mutation and tail extension/retraction. The size-conditional `try_extend`/`try_discard` primitives could pull the tail operations out from under it, leaving it to guard only the free list — but the win is small. Tail operations are not the common case, and a thread doing one still contends on the free-list mutex for the surrounding read-modify-write. While the free list remains a single mutex-guarded doubly-linked list (lock-free traversal is not possible yet), removing tail-op contention alone does not move the bottleneck — and it trades an obviously-correct design for an optimistic protocol resting on per-path ABA arguments (`try_*` checks payload *size*, not block identity).

## Typed region and I/O parameter types

**Feature flag:** None (additive API surface)
**Breaking change:** No

### Motivation

Many BStack and `BStackSlice` APIs share recurring parameter patterns that are passed as raw function arguments today:

- `(offset: u64, buf: impl AsRef<[u8]>)` — a write region: a position and the data to write there.
- `(offset: u64, buf: &mut [u8])` — a read region: a position and a buffer to fill; the length is implied by `buf.len()`.
- `(offset: u64, len: u64)` — a named range: a position and a byte count, with no associated data.
- `(a: u64, b: u64, len: u64)` — a cross-region pair: two positions and a shared length, as in `cross_exchange`.

These patterns appear in `set`, `get`, `get_range`, `zero`, `zero_range`, `cross_exchange`, `BStackOp::Read`, `BStackOp::Write`, and the generator closures for `get_batched_gen` and `process_gen`. Callers must remember the argument order and meaning at every call site. There is no type-level distinction between "an offset into this stack" and "a length", both of which are `u64`.

Introducing named types for these patterns — for example, `ReadRegion`, `WriteRegion`, `ByteRange`, and `CrossRegion` — would make call sites self-documenting and allow the compiler to reject transposed arguments.

### Design (sketch)

The types would be lightweight, `Copy` structs:

```rust
pub struct ByteRange       (Range<u64>);
pub struct ReadRegion<'a>  { pub offset: u64, pub buf: &'a mut [u8] }
pub struct WriteRegion<'a> { pub offset: u64, pub data: &'a [u8] }
pub struct CrossRegion     { pub src: u64, pub dst: u64, pub len: u64 }
```

Existing methods would gain overloaded entry points accepting these types via `Into` or `From`, or new companion methods alongside the originals. `BStackOp` variants could also be restructured around them. No existing call site would break.

### Open questions

- **Is the benefit real?** The patterns already have named parameters in Rust function signatures (`offset`, `buf`, `len`), so transposition is not silent — the compiler infers types, and `buf: impl AsRef<[u8]>` versus `len: u64` are already distinct. The main gain is readability at call sites, which is a matter of taste.
- **Proliferation cost.** Four new public types add documentation surface, appear in error messages, and must be maintained indefinitely. If the API grows, more pattern types may follow.
- **Naming.** The names above are illustrative. Alternatives: `Span`, `Slice` (conflicts with `BStackSlice`), `Region`, `Segment`. The right name should not collide with existing types and should signal that these are I/O coordinates, not data containers.
