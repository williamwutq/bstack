All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Windows support**: Full first-class Windows support with `LockFileEx` for exclusive file locking and `ReadFile` with `OVERLAPPED` for cursor-safe positional reads
- **Concurrent reads on Windows**: `peek` and `get` operations now use the read lock on Windows, enabling concurrent readers just like on Unix
- **Cross-platform durability**: `FlushFileBuffers` on Windows provides equivalent durability guarantees to `fdatasync` on Unix

### Changed
- Updated thread-safety documentation to reflect Windows support alongside Unix
- Updated multi-process safety documentation to cover both `flock` (Unix) and `LockFileEx` (Windows)
- Extended concurrent reads test to run on both Unix and Windows platforms

### Dependencies
- Added `windows-sys` crate for Windows platform support

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **`get` method**: Read arbitrary half-open byte ranges `[start, end)` from logical offsets
- **Concurrent reads on Unix**: `peek` and `get` operations now use `pread(2)` and take only the read lock, allowing multiple concurrent readers
- **Enhanced durability on macOS**: `durable_sync` now uses `F_FULLFSYNC` to flush the drive's hardware write cache, providing stronger guarantees than plain `fdatasync`

### Changed
- Updated thread-safety model documentation to reflect read-lock usage for `peek`/`get` on Unix

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- Initial release of `bstack`: A persistent, fsync-durable binary stack backed by a single file
- Core operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `len`
- Crash recovery with committed-length sentinel
- Multi-process safety via advisory `flock` on Unix
- File format with 16-byte header containing magic number and committed length
- Durability guarantees with `durable_sync` (fdatasync on Unix)
- Optional `set` feature for in-place payload mutation
