# bstack

A persistent, fsync-durable binary stack backed by a single file.

`push` and `pop` perform a *durable sync* before returning, so data survives a
process crash or unclean shutdown.  On **macOS**, `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)` is used
instead of `fdatasync` to flush the drive's hardware write cache, which plain
`fdatasync` does not guarantee.

A 16-byte file header stores a **magic number** and a **committed-length
sentinel**.  On reopen, any mismatch between the header and the actual file
size is repaired automatically — no user intervention required.

On **Unix**, `open` acquires an **exclusive advisory `flock`**; on
**Windows**, `LockFileEx` is used instead.  Both prevent two processes from
concurrently corrupting the same stack file.

**Minimal dependencies (`libc` on Unix, `windows-sys` on Windows).  No `unsafe` beyond required FFI calls.**

> **Warning:** bstack files must only be opened through this crate or a
> compatible implementation that understands the file format, header protocol,
> and locking semantics.  Reading or writing the file with raw tools (`dd`,
> `xxd`, custom `open(2)` calls, etc.) while a `BStack` instance is live, or
> manually editing the header fields, can silently corrupt the committed-length
> sentinel or bypass the advisory lock.  **The authors make no guarantees about
> the behaviour of the crate — including freedom from data loss or logical
> corruption — when the file has been accessed outside of this crate's
> controlled interface.**

## Quick start

```rust
use bstack::BStack;

let stack = BStack::open("log.bin")?;

// push appends bytes and returns the starting logical offset.
let off0 = stack.push(b"hello")?;  // 0
let off1 = stack.push(b"world")?;  // 5

assert_eq!(stack.len()?, 10);

// peek reads from a logical offset to the end.
assert_eq!(stack.peek(off1)?, b"world");

// get reads an arbitrary half-open logical byte range.
assert_eq!(stack.get(3, 8)?, b"lowor");

// pop removes bytes from the tail and returns them.
assert_eq!(stack.pop(5)?, b"world");
assert_eq!(stack.len()?, 5);
```

## API

```

## Standard I/O adapters

### Writing — `impl Write for BStack` / `impl Write for &BStack`

`BStack` implements [`std::io::Write`].  Each call to `write` is forwarded to
`push`, so every write is atomically appended and durably synced before
returning.  `flush` is a no-op.

`&BStack` also implements `Write` (mirroring `impl Write for &File`), which
lets you pass a shared reference wherever a writer is expected.

```rust
use std::io::Write;
use bstack::BStack;

let mut stack = BStack::open("log.bin")?;

// write / write_all forward to push.
stack.write_all(b"hello")?;
stack.write_all(b"world")?;
assert_eq!(stack.len()?, 10);

// io::copy works out of the box.
let mut src = std::io::Cursor::new(b"more data");
std::io::copy(&mut src, &mut stack)?;
```

Wrapping in `BufWriter` batches small writes into fewer `push` calls (and
fewer `durable_sync` calls):

```rust
use std::io::{BufWriter, Write};
use bstack::BStack;

let stack = BStack::open("log.bin")?;
let mut bw = BufWriter::new(&stack);
for chunk in chunks {
    bw.write_all(chunk)?;
}
bw.flush()?; // one push + one durable_sync for the whole batch
```

> **Note:** Each raw `write` call issues one `durable_sync`.  If you call
> `write` or `write_all` in a tight loop, prefer `push` directly or use
> `BufWriter` to batch.

### Reading — `BStackReader`

[`BStackReader`] wraps a `&BStack` with a cursor and implements
[`std::io::Read`] and [`std::io::Seek`].

```rust
use std::io::{Read, Seek, SeekFrom};
use bstack::{BStack, BStackReader};

let stack = BStack::open("log.bin")?;
stack.push(b"hello world")?;

// From the beginning:
let mut reader = stack.reader();

// From an arbitrary offset:
let mut mid = stack.reader_at(6);

// From<&BStack> is also implemented:
let mut r = BStackReader::from(&stack);

let mut buf = [0u8; 5];
reader.read_exact(&mut buf)?;  // b"hello"

reader.seek(SeekFrom::Start(6))?;
reader.read_exact(&mut buf)?;  // b"world"

// read_to_end, BufReader, etc. all work.
let mut out = Vec::new();
stack.reader().read_to_end(&mut out)?;
```

`BStackReader` borrows the stack immutably, so multiple readers can coexist
and run concurrently with each other and with `peek`/`get` calls.

## Trait implementations

### `BStack`

| Trait              | Semantics                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PartialEq` / `Eq` | **Pointer identity.** Two values are equal iff they are the same instance. No two distinct `BStack` values in one process can refer to the same file. |
| `Hash`             | Hashes the instance address — consistent with pointer-identity equality.                                                                              |

### `BStackReader`

| Trait | Semantics |
|-------|-----------|
| `PartialEq` / `Eq` | Equal when both the `BStack` pointer and the cursor offset match. |
| `Hash` | Hashes `(BStack pointer, offset)`. |
| `PartialOrd` / `Ord` | Ordered by `BStack` instance address, then by cursor offset. |

### `BStackSlice` (`alloc` feature)

| Trait                            | Semantics                                                                                               |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PartialEq` / `Eq`               | Compares `(offset, len)`. The allocator reference is **not** compared.                                  |
| `Hash`                           | Hashes `(offset, len)`.                                                                                 |
| `PartialOrd` / `Ord`             | Ordered by `offset`, then `len`.                                                                        |
| `From<BStackSlice> for [u8; 16]` | Serialises to `[offset_le8 ‖ len_le8]` for on-disk storage. Reconstruct with `BStackSlice::from_bytes`. |

### `BStackSliceReader` and `BStackSliceWriter` (`alloc` / `alloc + set` features)

| Trait                | Semantics                                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PartialEq` / `Eq`   | Equal when the underlying slice (`offset` + `len`) and cursor position both match.   |
| `Hash`               | Hashes `(slice, cursor)`.                                                            |
| `PartialOrd` / `Ord` | Ordered by absolute payload position (`slice.start() + cursor`), then `slice.len()`. |

Reader and writer are also **cross-comparable**: `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` are defined between
`BStackSliceReader` and `BStackSliceWriter` using the same `(abs_pos, len)` key, so the two cursor
types can be mixed in sorted collections. Both also implement `PartialEq<BStackSlice>` (cursor
position is ignored for that comparison).

## Feature flags

### `atomic`

Enables compound read-modify-write operations that hold the write lock across
what would otherwise be separate calls, providing thread-level atomicity and
crash-safe ordering.

```toml
[dependencies]
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["atomic"] }
# Combined set + atomic unlocks swap, swap_into, and cas:
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["set", "atomic"] }
```

#### `atrunc(n, buf)` — truncate then append

Cut `n` bytes off the tail then append `buf` in one locked operation.  
Equivalent to `discard(n)` + `push(buf)` but with no intermediate visible state.

```rust
stack.push(b"hello world")?;
stack.atrunc(6, b"Rust")?; // remove " world", append "Rust"
assert_eq!(stack.peek(0)?, b"helloRust");
```

#### `splice(n, buf) -> Vec<u8>` — pop then append, returning removed bytes

Remove and return the last `n` bytes, then append `buf`.  
Equivalent to `pop(n)` + `push(buf)` but atomically.

```rust
stack.push(b"hello world")?;
let removed = stack.splice(5, b"Rust")?;
assert_eq!(removed, b"world");
assert_eq!(stack.peek(0)?, b"hello Rust");
```

#### `splice_into(old, new)` — pop into buffer then append

Same as `splice` but reads the removed bytes into a caller-supplied `old`
slice instead of allocating a `Vec`, where `n = old.len()`.

```rust
stack.push(b"hello world")?;
let mut buf = [0u8; 5];
stack.splice_into(&mut buf, b"Rust")?;
assert_eq!(&buf, b"world");
```

#### `try_extend(s, buf) -> bool` — conditional append

Append `buf` only if the current logical payload size equals `s`.  Returns
`true` on success, `false` if the size did not match (no-op).  Useful for
optimistic, lock-free–style append protocols.

```rust
let len = stack.len()?;
if stack.try_extend(len, b"new entry\n")? {
    // appended
} else {
    // someone else wrote first; retry
}
```

#### `try_discard(s, n) -> bool` — conditional discard

Discard `n` bytes only if the current logical payload size equals `s`.  Returns
`true` on success, `false` if the size did not match.

```rust
let len = stack.len()?;
if stack.try_discard(len, 4)? {
    // last 4 bytes removed
}
```

#### `replace(n, f)` — read tail, transform, write new tail

Pop `n` bytes off the tail, pass them read-only to a callback, then write
whatever the callback returns as the new tail.  The file grows or shrinks
according to the returned `Vec` length, using the same crash-safe two-path
ordering as `atrunc`.

```rust
stack.push(b"hello world")?;
stack.replace(5, |tail| {
    tail.iter().map(|b| b.to_ascii_uppercase()).collect()
})?;
assert_eq!(stack.peek(0)?, b"hello WORLD");
```

---

#### `swap(offset, buf) -> Vec<u8>` — atomic read-then-overwrite *(requires `set`)*

Read `buf.len()` bytes at `offset`, overwrite them with `buf`, and return the
old contents.  The file size never changes.

```rust
stack.push(b"helloworld")?;
let old = stack.swap(5, b"WORLD")?;
assert_eq!(old, b"world");
assert_eq!(stack.peek(0)?, b"helloWORLD");
```

#### `swap_into(offset, buf)` — atomic read-then-overwrite into buffer *(requires `set`)*

Same as `swap` but exchanges in-place through a caller-supplied buffer: on
entry `buf` holds the new bytes; on return `buf` holds the old bytes.

```rust
let mut buf = *b"WORLD";
stack.swap_into(5, &mut buf)?;
// buf now holds the old bytes at offset 5
```

#### `cas(offset, old, new) -> bool` — compare-and-exchange *(requires `set`)*

Read `old.len()` bytes at `offset` and, if they match `old`, overwrite them
with `new`.  Returns `true` if the exchange was performed, `false` if the
comparison failed or the lengths differ.  The file size never changes.

```rust
stack.push(b"helloworld")?;
let swapped = stack.cas(5, b"world", b"WORLD")?;
assert!(swapped);
assert_eq!(stack.peek(0)?, b"helloWORLD");
```

#### `process(start, end, f)` — read range, mutate in place, write back *(requires `set`)*

Read bytes in `[start, end)`, pass them to a callback as a `&mut [u8]` for
in-place mutation, then write the modified bytes back.  The file size is never
changed.  `start == end` is a valid no-op.

```rust
stack.push(b"hello world")?;
stack.process(6, 11, |buf| {
    buf.make_ascii_uppercase();
})?;
assert_eq!(stack.peek(0)?, b"hello WORLD");
```

---

### `set`

`BStack::set(offset, data)` — in-place overwrite of existing payload bytes
without changing the file size or the committed-length header.

`BStack::zero(offset, n)` — in-place overwrite of `n` bytes with zeros,
without changing the file size or the committed-length header.  Equivalent to
`set` with a zero-filled buffer but avoids a caller-supplied allocation.

```toml
[dependencies]
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["set"] }
```

### `alloc`

Enables the region-management layer on top of `BStack`:
`BStackAllocator`, `BStackBulkAllocator`, `BStackSlice`, `BStackSliceReader`, and
`LinearBStackAllocator`.

```toml
[dependencies]
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc"] }
# In-place slice writes (BStackSliceWriter) also need `set`:
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc", "set"] }
# Experimental FirstFitBStackAllocator requires both alloc and set:
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc", "set"] }
```

---

## Allocator (`alloc` feature)

The `alloc` feature adds typed region management over a `BStack` payload.

### `BStackAllocator` trait

A trait for types that own a `BStack` and manage contiguous byte regions
within its payload.  Implementors must provide:

```rust
pub trait BStackAllocator: Sized {
    fn stack(&self) -> &BStack;
    fn into_stack(self) -> BStack;
    fn alloc(&self, len: u64) -> io::Result<BStackSlice<'_, Self>>;
    fn realloc<'a>(&'a self, slice: BStackSlice<'a, Self>, new_len: u64)
        -> io::Result<BStackSlice<'a, Self>>;

    // Default no-op; override for free-list allocators:
    fn dealloc(&self, slice: BStackSlice<'_, Self>) -> io::Result<()> { Ok(()) }

    // Delegation helpers:
    fn len(&self) -> io::Result<u64>;
    fn is_empty(&self) -> io::Result<bool>;
}
```

For batch allocation and deallocation, see [`BStackBulkAllocator`](#bstackbulkallocator-trait).

### `BStackBulkAllocator` trait

An extension trait for `BStackAllocator` that adds two required, atomic bulk
methods.  "Atomic" here means: either the operation succeeds completely, or the
backing store is left entirely unchanged — no partial allocation or deallocation.
Crash safety wise, the durable state of the allocator after a crash is always
consistent or recovery is guaranteed to succeed, even if the crash occurs in the
middle of an operation. The atomicity guarantee does not need to apply completely
to a crash, but it must apply to the state of the allocator as observed by the next
successful operation after a crash.

```rust
pub trait BStackBulkAllocator: BStackAllocator {
    /// Allocate one slice per entry in `lengths` in a single atomic operation.
    fn alloc_bulk(&self, lengths: impl AsRef<[u64]>)
        -> io::Result<Vec<BStackSlice<'_, Self>>>;

    /// Deallocate all supplied slices in a single atomic operation.
    fn dealloc_bulk<'a>(&'a self, slices: impl AsRef<[BStackSlice<'a, Self>]>)
        -> io::Result<()>;
}
```

### `BStackSlice<'a, A>`

A lightweight `Copy` handle — one `&'a A` reference plus two `u64` fields
(`offset`, `len`) — to a contiguous region of the allocator's `BStack`.
Produced by `BStackAllocator::alloc`; consumed by `realloc` and `dealloc`.

> **Slice origin requirement.** `realloc` and `dealloc` are only guaranteed to
> work correctly with a slice that was returned directly by `alloc` or by a
> prior call to `realloc` on the **same allocator instance**.  Passing an
> arbitrary sub-slice obtained via `subslice`, `subslice_range`, or a manually
> constructed `BStackSlice::new` is not supported and may silently corrupt the
> allocator's internal state.  If you need to preserve a slice handle across a
> file reopen, serialise the raw `(start, len)` fields and reconstruct the
> slice via `BStackSlice::new` only for read/write I/O — never pass a
> reconstructed slice back to `realloc` or `dealloc`.

### `BStackSliceReader<'a, A>`

A cursor-based reader over a `BStackSlice`.  Implements `io::Read` and
`io::Seek` within the slice's coordinate space (position 0 = `slice.start()`).
Constructed via `BStackSlice::reader()` or `BStackSlice::reader_at(offset)`.

### `LinearBStackAllocator`

The reference bump allocator.  Regions are appended sequentially to the tail.

| Operation              | Underlying call   | Crash-safe |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| `alloc`                | `BStack::extend`  | yes        |
| `alloc_bulk`           | `BStack::extend`  | yes        |
| `realloc` grow         | `BStack::extend`  | yes        |
| `realloc` shrink       | `BStack::discard` | yes        |
| `dealloc` (tail)       | `BStack::discard` | yes        |
| `dealloc` (non-tail)   | no-op             | yes        |
| `dealloc_bulk` (tail)  | `BStack::discard` | yes        |

`realloc` returns `io::ErrorKind::Unsupported` for non-tail slices.

### Experimental `FirstFitBStackAllocator` (`alloc + set` features)

Experimental: A persistent first-fit free-list allocator.  Freed regions are tracked on disk
in a doubly-linked intrusive free list and reused for future allocations, so
the file does not grow without bound.

```toml
[dependencies]
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc", "set"] }
```

#### On-disk layout

The allocator occupies the entire `BStack` payload.  The first 48 payload
bytes are a header region, followed immediately by the block arena:

```
┌──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  reserved (16 B)     │ allocator header (32 B)                           │
│  (custom use)        │ magic[8] | flags[4] | _reserved[4] | free_head[8] │
└──────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
^                      ^                                                   ^
payload offset 0       offset 16                                       offset 48
                                                                     (arena start)
```

Every allocation in the arena is:

```
[ BlockHeader 16 B | payload (size bytes) | BlockFooter 8 B ]
```

* **BlockHeader** — `size: u64`, `flags: u32` (bit 0 = `is_free`), `_reserved: u32`.
* **BlockFooter** — `size: u64` (mirrors the header, used for leftward coalescing).
* **Free blocks** additionally store `next_free: u64` and `prev_free: u64` in the
  first 16 bytes of their payload, forming an intrusive doubly-linked list.

The minimum allocation size is 16 bytes; all sizes are rounded up to a multiple of 8.

#### Allocation policy

`alloc` walks the free list from the head and takes the first block whose size
≥ the aligned request (**first-fit**).  If the found block is large enough to
yield a remainder of at least 16 bytes after splitting, the remainder is left
as a new free block; the allocated portion is carved from the back.  When no
free block fits, the arena is extended by pushing a new block onto the stack.

#### Coalescing

`dealloc` merges the freed block with adjacent free neighbours (right then
left).  If the merged block reaches the stack tail it is discarded immediately.
A cascade check removes any further free blocks newly exposed at the tail,
maintaining the invariant that the tail block is always allocated.

#### Crash consistency

Multi-step operations set a `recovery_needed` flag in the allocator header
before mutating the free list and clear it after all writes complete.  On the
next `FirstFitBStackAllocator::new`, if `recovery_needed` is set, a single
linear scan of the arena rebuilds the free list from the `is_free` flags in
block headers — stored pointer values are not trusted.  Any partial tail block
is also truncated.

#### Example

```rust
use bstack::{BStack, BStackAllocator, FirstFitBStackAllocator};

let alloc = FirstFitBStackAllocator::new(BStack::open("data.bstack")?)?;

let a = alloc.alloc(64)?;
let b = alloc.alloc(64)?;
a.write(b"hello world")?;

alloc.dealloc(a)?;        // freed; slot available for reuse

let c = alloc.alloc(64)?; // reuses a's slot
assert_eq!(c.start(), a.start());

let stack = alloc.into_stack();
```

### Lifetime model

`BStackSlice<'a, A>` borrows the **allocator** for `'a`, not the `BStack`
directly.  This lets the borrow checker statically prevent calling
`into_stack()` — which consumes the allocator — while any slice is still alive.

### Example

```rust
use bstack::{BStack, BStackAllocator, LinearBStackAllocator};

let alloc = LinearBStackAllocator::new(BStack::open("data.bstack")?);

let slice = alloc.alloc(128)?;     // reserve 128 zero bytes
let data  = slice.read()?;         // read them back
alloc.dealloc(slice)?;             // release (tail → O(1) discard)

let stack = alloc.into_stack();    // reclaim the BStack
```

### `GhostTreeBstackAllocator` (`alloc` feature)

A pure-AVL general-purpose allocator built on top of a [`BStack`]. Free blocks
store their AVL node inline at offset 0 within the block — live allocations
carry **zero** overhead (no headers, no footers). The tree is keyed on
`(size, address)` for a strict total order. All memory is kept zeroed: the
BStack zeroes on extension, and the allocator zeroes on free.

Implements both `BStackAllocator` and `BStackBulkAllocator`.

```toml
[dependencies]
bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc"] }
```

| Operation               | Strategy                                         | Crash-safe  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `alloc`                 | best-fit from AVL tree, or `extend`              | multi-call  |
| `alloc_bulk`            | one block for the combined size, then split      | single-call |
| `realloc` same block    | in-place length update; zero gap on shrink       | multi-call  |
| `realloc` shrink (tail) | zero gap, `discard` freed tail                   | multi-call  |
| `realloc` shrink        | zero gap + freed tail, AVL insert                | multi-call  |
| `realloc` grow (tail)   | `extend` in-place — no copy                      | single-call |
| `realloc` grow          | alloc new, copy, dealloc old                     | multi-call  |
| `dealloc` (tail)        | `discard` — O(1), no AVL insert                  | single-call |
| `dealloc`               | zero block, AVL insert                           | multi-call  |
| `dealloc_bulk`          | merge adjacent slices, then tail-truncate/insert | multi-call  |

#### On-disk layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐  payload offset 0
│   User-reserved (32 bytes)  │
├─────────────────────────────┤  offset 32
│   Magic number (8 bytes)    │  "ALGT\x00\x01\x00\x00"
├─────────────────────────────┤  offset 40

├─────────────────────────────┤  offset 48  ← arena start (32-byte aligned)
│   ... heap grows upward ... │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Allocation policy

`alloc` searches the AVL tree for the smallest free block that can satisfy the
request (best-fit). If no suitable block exists, the arena is extended.

`alloc_bulk` rounds each requested length up to 32 bytes individually, sums
them, and allocates one contiguous block (one AVL remove or one `extend`). The
block is sliced into per-request regions. When all slices are returned together
to `dealloc_bulk`, adjacent slices are merged and freed as a single operation
— typically one `discard` if they are at the tail.

#### Crash consistency

No write-ahead log, no checksums. A crash during `dealloc` before the AVL
insert permanently loses that block. A crash during rotation leaves the tree
imbalanced — corrected on the next `GhostTreeBstackAllocator::new`.

#### Example

```rust
use bstack::{BStack, BStackAllocator, BStackBulkAllocator, GhostTreeBstackAllocator};

let alloc = GhostTreeBstackAllocator::new(BStack::open("data.bstack")?)?;

let a = alloc.alloc(64)?;
let b = alloc.alloc(64)?;
a.write(b"hello world")?;

alloc.dealloc(a)?;        // freed; slot available for reuse

let c = alloc.alloc(64)?; // may reuse a's slot

// Bulk: one block allocation, one block free when returned together.
let slices = alloc.alloc_bulk(&[32, 64, 128])?;
alloc.dealloc_bulk(&slices)?;

let stack = alloc.into_stack();
```

## File format

```
┌────────────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│      header (16 B)     │  payload 0   │  payload 1   │  ...
│  magic[8] | clen[8 LE] │              │              │

```

* **`magic`** — 8 bytes: `BSTK` + major(1 B) + minor(1 B) + patch(1 B) + reserved(1 B).
  This version writes `BSTK\x00\x01\x08\x00` (0.1.8).  `open` accepts any
  0.1.x file (first 6 bytes `BSTK\x00\x01`) and rejects a different major or
  minor as incompatible.
* **`clen`** — little-endian `u64` recording the last successfully committed
  payload length.  Updated on every `push` and `pop` before the durable sync.

All user-visible offsets (returned by `push`, accepted by `peek`/`get`) are
**logical** — 0-based from the start of the payload region (file byte 16).

## Durability

**`durable_sync` on macOS** issues `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)`.  Unlike `fdatasync`,
this flushes the drive controller's write cache, providing the same "barrier
to stable media" guarantee that `fsync` gives on Linux.  Falls back to
`sync_data` if the device does not support `F_FULLFSYNC`.

**`durable_sync` on Linux / other Unix** calls `sync_data` (`fdatasync`).

**`durable_sync` on Windows** calls `sync_data`, which maps to
`FlushFileBuffers`.  This flushes the kernel write-back cache and waits for
the drive to acknowledge, providing equivalent durability to `fdatasync`.

**Push rollback:** if the write or sync fails, a best-effort `ftruncate` and
header reset restore the pre-push state.

---

## Crash recovery

The committed-length sentinel in the header ensures automatic recovery on the
next `open`:

| Condition               | Cause                                             | Recovery                                  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `file_size − 16 > clen` | partial tail write (crashed before header update) | truncate to `16 + clen`, durable-sync     |
| `file_size − 16 < clen` | partial truncation (crashed before header update) | set `clen = file_size − 16`, durable-sync |

No caller action is required; recovery is transparent.

---

## Multi-process safety

On **Unix**, `open` calls `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on the file.  If another
process already holds the lock, `open` returns immediately with
`io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock`.  The lock is released when the `BStack` is
dropped.

On **Windows**, `open` calls `LockFileEx` with
`LOCKFILE_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK | LOCKFILE_FAIL_IMMEDIATELY` covering the entire
file range.  The same `WouldBlock` semantics apply (`ERROR_LOCK_VIOLATION`
maps to `io::ErrorKind::WouldBlock` in Rust).  The lock is released when the
`BStack` is dropped.

> Both `flock` (Unix) and `LockFileEx` (Windows) are advisory and per-process.
> They protect against concurrent `BStack::open` calls across well-behaved
> processes, not against raw file access.

---

## Thread safety

`BStack` wraps the file in a `RwLock<File>`.

| Operation                                                    | Lock (Unix / Windows) | Lock (other) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| `push`, `extend`, `pop`, `pop_into`, `discard`               | write                 | write        |
| `set`, `zero` *(feature)*                                    | write                 | write        |

| `try_discard(s, n > 0)` *(atomic)*                           | write                 | write        |
| `try_discard(s, 0)` *(atomic)*                               | **read**              | **read**     |
| `swap`, `swap_into`, `cas` *(set+atomic)*                    | write                 | write        |
| `process` *(set+atomic)*                                     | write                 | write        |
| `replace` *(atomic)*                                         | write                 | write        |
| `peek`, `peek_into`, `get`, `get_into`                       | **read**              | write        |
| `len`                                                        | read                  | read         |

On Unix and Windows, `peek`, `peek_into`, `get`, and `get_into` use a
cursor-safe positional read (`pread(2)` / `read_exact_at` on Unix; `ReadFile`
with `OVERLAPPED` via `seek_read` on Windows) that does not modify the shared
file-position cursor.  Multiple concurrent calls to any of these methods can
therefore run in parallel.  Any in-progress `push`, `pop`, or `pop_into` still
blocks all readers via the write lock, so readers always observe a consistent,
committed state.

On other platforms a seek is required; `peek`, `peek_into`, `get`, and
`get_into` fall back to the write lock and reads serialise.

---

## Known limitations

- **No record framing.** The file stores raw bytes; the caller must track how
  many bytes each logical record occupies.
- **Push rollback is best-effort.** A failure during rollback is silently
  swallowed; crash recovery on the next `open` will repair the state.
- **No `O_DIRECT`.** Writes go through the page cache; durability relies on
  `durable_sync`, not cache bypass.
- **Single file only.** There is no WAL, manifest, or secondary index.
- **Multi-process lock is advisory.** `flock` (Unix) and `LockFileEx` (Windows) protect well-behaved processes but not raw file access.

## Why async (Tokio) integration is not planned

`bstack` is deliberately synchronous, and async support would add real cost for
no meaningful gain.  The reasons below are structural, not incidental.

### 1. Durability is an inherently blocking syscall

The entire value proposition of `bstack` is that `push` and `pop` do not return
until the data is on stable storage.  That contract is fulfilled by
`fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)` on macOS, `fdatasync` on other Unix, and
`FlushFileBuffers` on Windows.  All three are blocking syscalls that park the
calling thread until the drive acknowledges the write.

In an async runtime, blocking syscalls must be offloaded to a thread pool via
`spawn_blocking`.  So an "async `push`" would simply be:

```rust
tokio::task::spawn_blocking(|| stack.push(data)).await
```

That is not necessary to be added as an async method on `BStack` itself, since the blocking nature of the operation is already clear from the API and documentation. The above pattern is idiomatic for using blocking operations in a Tokio application.

### 2. No I/O concurrency to exploit

Async I/O improves throughput when multiple independent operations can be
in-flight simultaneously.  `bstack` cannot do this:

- **Writes are ordered.** Each `push` extends the file at the tail and updates
  the committed-length header.  Reordering or interleaving writes would corrupt
  the header or produce a torn committed length.
- **Every write ends with a barrier.** `durable_sync` must complete before the
  next operation starts; there is nothing to pipeline.
- **Operations are serialised by a `RwLock`.** Concurrent writes already block
  on each other.  Wrapping that in `async` would only add overhead.

### 3. The file lock is blocking and must not run on an async thread

`open` calls `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on Unix or `LockFileEx` on Windows.
Blocking on a mutex inside an async executor stalls the thread and starves
other tasks on the same worker.  Moving the lock acquisition to
`spawn_blocking` is again just synchronous I/O on a thread pool.

### 4. Tokio would break the minimal-dependencies guarantee

`bstack` currently depends only on `libc` (Unix) and `windows-sys` (Windows).
Pulling in `tokio` — even as an optional dependency — would introduce a large
transitive dependency tree that affects every user of the crate, including the
many users who do not use an async runtime at all.

### What to do in async code

If you are using `bstack` from inside a Tokio application, the idiomatic
approach is:

```rust
let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || {
    stack.push(&data)
}).await?;
```
