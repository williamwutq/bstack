//! Allocator abstraction for [`BStack`]-backed region management.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This module provides two public items:
//!
//! * [`BStackSlice`] — a lifetime-coupled handle to a contiguous region of a
//!   [`BStack`] payload.  It is a lightweight `Copy` value (one reference plus
//!   two `u64`s) that exposes [`read`](BStackSlice::read),
//!   [`read_into`](BStackSlice::read_into), and (with the `set` feature)
//!   [`write`](BStackSlice::write) and [`zero`](BStackSlice::zero).
//!
//! * [`BStackAllocator`] — a trait for types that own a [`BStack`] and manage
//!   regions within it.  It standardises [`alloc`](BStackAllocator::alloc),
//!   [`realloc`](BStackAllocator::realloc), [`dealloc`](BStackAllocator::dealloc),
//!   and [`into_stack`](BStackAllocator::into_stack).
//!
//! [`LinearBStackAllocator`] is the reference implementation: a simple bump
//! allocator that always appends to the tail.
//!
//! # Lifetime model
//!
//! `BStackSlice<'a, A>` borrows the **allocator** `A` for `'a`, not the
//! underlying [`BStack`] directly.  Tying the lifetime to the allocator has
//! two important consequences:
//!
//! 1. **`into_stack` is statically gated.** [`BStackAllocator::into_stack`]
//!    consumes the allocator by value.  Because outstanding slices borrow
//!    `&'a A`, the borrow checker prevents moving the allocator out while any
//!    slice is still in scope.
//!
//! 2. **The dependency is honest.** A slice's validity depends on the
//!    allocator — not just on the file being open.  Tying `'a` to `&'a BStack`
//!    only prevents the file from closing; the stack could still be freely
//!    resized through interior mutability, silently invalidating the handle.
//!    Tying `'a` to the allocator makes the dependency explicit.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This entire module requires the `alloc` Cargo feature:
//!
//! ```toml
//! bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc"] }
//! ```
//!
//! In-place slice writes additionally require the `set` feature:
//!
//! ```toml
//! bstack = { version = "0.1", features = ["alloc", "set"] }
//! ```
//!
//! # Realloc contract for non-tail slices
//!
//! [`BStack`] only grows and shrinks at the tail.  Resizing the **last**
//! (tail) allocation is O(1).  Resizing a **non-tail** allocation cannot be
//! done in place.  Implementors of [`BStackAllocator`] must adopt one of:
//!
//! a. **Return `Unsupported`** — return `Err(io::ErrorKind::Unsupported)`.
//!    [`LinearBStackAllocator`] uses this strategy.
//! b. **Copy-and-move** — read old data, push a new region, mark the old
//!    region free, and return a new [`BStackSlice`] at the new offset.
//!
//! # Crash consistency
//!
//! Every individual [`BStack`] operation — [`extend`](BStack::extend),
//! [`discard`](BStack::discard), [`set`](BStack::set), etc. — performs a
//! durable sync before returning and is individually crash-safe: a process
//! crash mid-operation leaves the file in the last fully committed state.
//!
//! At the *allocator* level, operations that require more than one [`BStack`]
//! call are **not** automatically atomic.  A crash between two calls leaves
//! the file in an intermediate state that the allocator must be prepared to
//! recover from on the next [`BStack::open`].
//!
//! Implementors must document which of the following two categories each of
//! their operations falls into:
//!
//! **Single-call (crash-safe by inheritance):** Any operation that maps
//! directly to one [`BStack`] call — such as `alloc` → `extend`, tail
//! `realloc` → `extend`/`discard`, or tail `dealloc` → `discard` — inherits
//! the crash safety of that underlying call.
//!
//! **Multi-call (requires explicit recovery design):** Operations that issue
//! two or more [`BStack`] calls — such as a copy-and-move `realloc` that
//! pushes new data, updates a metadata region, and then marks the old region
//! free — must be designed so that a crash at any step leaves the file in a
//! state that the allocator can detect and recover from on re-open.  The usual
//! technique is to write new data before updating the pointer/metadata that
//! makes it visible (write-ahead), so that a partial update is either fully
//! applied or fully invisible after recovery.
//!
//! Note that writing into an allocation via [`BStackSlice::write`] is a
//! separate operation from [`BStackAllocator::alloc`].  A crash between the
//! two leaves the allocated region filled with zeros (the initial state from
//! [`BStack::extend`]).  This is typically fine — the data simply hasn't been
//! written yet — but callers that need write-then-allocate atomicity must
//! arrange it themselves.
